贾中进的私人项目-公开源代码<br/>
The project is the private one that ZhongJin Jia committed,but the source code is public. <br/>
This project is based on the bootstrap(http://getbootstrap.com/) <br/>
,The UI Template is from AdminTLE(https://www.almsaeedstudio.com/) ,thanks AdminTLE !  

Already add Android, for a test sample to do the same thing as the website. <br/>
And because of the CSS issue, will end up here. Then do android developing on the project if i study more CSS skill , experience. <br/>

# How TO Build 
You need install maven in your computer, then go the root to run "mvn clean install" . the war file uner jframework-me directory can be deploy. or you can start the project using Jetty through running JettyServerHelper Class .  Also note : you need change the default ip address in the youapp-config.js file. Now you can get the sample running.
