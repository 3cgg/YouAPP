贾中进的私人项目-公开源代码<br/>
The project ZhongJin commit is the private,but the source code is public.<br/>
This project constructes on the bootstrap(http://getbootstrap.com/) platform <br/>
,the UI template is supported by AdminTLE(https://www.almsaeedstudio.com/),thanks AdminTLE!  
<br/>
Also already add Android,which is a test sample to do the same thing as the website.<br/>
But because of the CSS issue of Android platform,the progress ends up here.May continue to develop Android if i study more CSS skill/experience.<br/>

#How to build 
To install maven in your computer, then go the root of the project to run "mvn clean install" . the war file under the jframework-youapp-war-tomcat/target directory is for deploying.Or you can setup the project through running JettyServerHelper Class via Jetty.Also note:change the default ip address of endpoint of receiving HTTP request in the youapp-config.js file. 
Now you can get the sample run.
